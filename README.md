## Guide
The game consists in 5 rooms in the following disposition (X are empty):

X F X

D E T

O X X


* E - Entrance: you can find a Sword to equip
* F - Forge: you can find a MagicRune to upgrade the Sword (IronKey needed)
* D - DarkRoom: you can find a IronKey
* O - OrcRoom: you can find a GoldenKey protected by an Orc
* T - TreasureChamber: you have to arrive here to win (GoldenKey needed)

To win you need to arrive to the TreasureChamber, and for that you need the GoldenKey protected by the orc. The orc is pretty strong so to win him you need to equip an upgraded sword, you will find the Sword at the entrance and you can upgraded combining it with the MagicRune found in the Forge and for entering the Forge you need the IronKey found in the DarkRoom.
